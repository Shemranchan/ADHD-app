A simple, focused, and modern web app built to help users with ADHD manage daily tasks with visual structure, priority sorting, and clear reminders.

This project is lightweight and designed to run locally using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (Flask optional for backend).

The ADHD Task Manager was designed to help kids and teens with ADHD stay organized in a simple, non-overwhelming way. 
Traditional task apps can feel cluttered or stressful — full of features that distract more than they help. This app keeps 
things minimal, visual, and easy to use, letting users focus on one task at a time. By splitting tasks into “Today” and “Tomorrow,” 
and providing clear reminders and visual cues, it helps reduce decision fatigue and procrastination. The built-in focus 
modal encourages users to complete tasks step by step, while the optional Spotify player and soft design elements create a 
calm, motivating workspace. Ultimately, it helps users build structure and consistency — two things that are often hardest but 
most rewarding for people with ADHD.
